# Overview

Many IP/MPLS networks provide services which are very sensitive to
traffic loss, which can occur when a node or link physically fails in
the network (or software running on those nodes fails). For these
networks, it is not acceptable to wait for protocol reconvergence to
complete before reprogramming the Data Plane – applications may be
sensitive to traffic loss greater than 10s of milliseconds. Technologies
like IP FRR, which allow backup routes to be pre-programmed in the
routers’ FIBs can significantly reduce the time it takes for a node to
recover after a failure has been detected. This proposal therefore
extends the SAI to allow pre-programming backup paths which is required
for a device to support IP FRR.

## Overview of IP FRR


When there is a link or a node failure in an IP network, it can take
several seconds for the Control Plane stack to converge the routers'
FIBs to a new, consistent state which avoids the failed resource. During
this time, the routers will still forward some packets along paths that
include the failed resources, and as a result those packets will be
black-holed. For some types of customer traffic (for example, real-time
collaboration applications and pseudowires) this is too long an outage,
and adversely affects the customer experience.

IP Fast Reroute (FRR) is intended to cut the window during which packets
are black-holed down to tens of milliseconds. It works as follows.

-   The routers compute a "safe" alternate next hop for each route in
    advance, to be used in case the primary next hop fails. See the
    example below for explanation what a “safe” alternative is.

-   The alternate next hop is then pre-loaded into the Switching Entity
    so that the time it takes the router to switch over to the alternate
    can be minimized.

This mechanism allows packets to continue to reach their destinations
while the Control Plane converges. Once the Control Plane has converged,
the routers start to forward using the new primary next hops of all
affected routes, and they compute a new set of alternate next hops,
ready for the next failure.

## Example

Let’s consider the following network topology as an example. In this
scenario router S programs its Switching Entity to forward traffic
destined for node D.

![](figures/sai_frr_example.png)

As the first step the Control Plane stack on S calculates shortest path
to D, which in this example is via node C. This is programmed to the
Switching Entity.

Then, Control Plane calculates the backup next hop. In this topology
there are two possible alternative paths to reach D – using node A or
node B as next hop. However, routing via node A is not a safe option.
This is because from A’s perspective, shortest path to D is via S.
Therefore if S sends any packets destined for D towards A, A will route
them back to S causing a micro-loop and quickly saturating the bandwidth
on the link between the nodes. The safe next hop alternative in this
topology is towards node B. When node B receives packets to D it will
route it over to C. Therefore Control Plane on node S programs a backup
next hop for destination D over interface towards B into the Switching
Entity.

In steady state, traffic to D is forwarded only via link to C and the
backup next hop is not used. If the link between S and C fails, the
Switching Entity immediately switches to forwarding traffic via the
protecting next hop. Then, after a while the Control Plane stack
converges and new set of next hops is programmed to the Switching
Entity.

## Failure detection and switchover triggers

The switchover from the primary next hop to backup is triggered once a failure
of a particular object is spotted.  This object can be a physical port, a tunnel
interface, BFD session, ICMP ECHO session etc.

It is preferred that the switchover is triggered by the switching entity without
involving control plane in the process.  This way the amount of time it takes to
switch traffic to the backup next hop is signifficantly smaller.

However, different models of hardware have different capabilities with respect
to the object that they can monitor.  For example, not all chipsets support running
BFD in the switch.  Therefore it is necessary that the control plane is also able
to trigger a switchover.  In the mentioned example, it is the control plane that
runs a BFD process and triggers a switchover when a particular BFD session fails.

Therefore, this proposal has to meet the following requirements:
-   Control plane must be able to learn about monitoring capabilities of the swithing entity.
-   If the switching entity supports monitoring of a particular object, control plane
    must be able to inform the switch which instance of this object should be
    monitored for a given next hop.
-   Control plane must be able to trigger a switchover if it decides to handle
    monitoring for failure.

# Proposal
## Current SAI object model

![](figures/sai_frr_current_model.png)

Current model allows programming multiple next hops for a given
destination. This is achieved by using a Next Hop Group object instead
of a single Next Hop when specifying Next hop id on the Route object.

Next Hop Group then has a list of Next Hop Group Members each of which
points to a single Next Hop.

At the moment this model assumes that the only case when a Next Hop
Group is used is ECMP.

## Proposed extensions

In order to allow Fast Reroute programming in the Switching Entity, we
propose to extend the Next Hop Group and Next Hop Group Member and Switch objects.

### Next Hop Group

Firstly, a new type of Next Hop Group is specified –
SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_TYPE\_PROTECTION. This indicates that the group
does not represent ECMP next hops but a primary-backup pair.

It is expected that the Control Plane stack will never attempt to
program more than two next hops within a single Protection Next Hop
Group. It is outside the scope of this proposal to specify how the
Adapter or Adapter Host should enforce this condition.

Additionally, new attribute is added to allow the Control Plane stack to
initiate and revert the failover. The new attribute is
SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_ATTR\_SET\_SWITCHOVER. This is required for
example in the scenario when the BFD process runs in the Control Plane
process rather than in the Switching Entity and the Control Plane stack
has to trigger a switchover “manually”.

### Next Hop Group Member

Two attributes are added to the Next Hop Group Member object to
indicate what is the configured and actual role of the referred next hop
in a protection group. The attributes are:

-   SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_MEMBER\_ATTR\_CONFIGURED\_ROLE
    -   This attribute is configurable and has to be specified when the
        next hop group member is created.
    -   It can take one of the following values:
        - SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_MEMBER\_CONFIGURED\_ROLE\_PRIMARY - The next hop group member is configured as primary and will forward traffic if there is no failure.
        - SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_MEMBER\_CONFIGURED\_ROLE\_STANDBY - The next hop group member is configured as a backup and will not forward traffic unless the primary fails.
-   SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_MEMBER\_ATTR\_OBSERVED\_ROLE
    -   This is a read-only attribute which represents the actual role
        of the referred next hop.
    -   It can take one of the following values:
        - SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_MEMBER\_OBSERVED\_ROLE\_ACTIVE - This next hop group member is currently forwarding traffic.
        - SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_MEMBER\_OBSERVED\_ROLE\_INACTIVE - This next hop is currently not forwarding any traffic.

Furthermore, an attribute is added to the Next Hop Group Member to identify
the object that needs to be monitored by the swithing entity.  The object must
be of one of the types that the hardware is able to monitor.

-  SAI\_NEXT\_HOP\_GROUP\_MEMBER\_ATTR\_MONITORED\_OBJECT

This attribute allows the switching entity to monitor a specified object
(BFD session, ICMP ECHO session, physical port, tunnel interface etc) and in case of its failure,
trigger a switchover.

If the referred object fails, then the switch marks the next hop as FAILED and does not use it for forwarding.
If the next hop group is a Protection type and there is a backup next hop available in the group, then it is no longer STANDBY, but FORWARDING and is used to forward traffic.

### SAI SWITCH

New attribute is added to SAI SWITCH to allow control plane to query the swtiching entity for the
list of object tpyes that it can monitor.
-  SAI\_SWITCH\_ATTR\_SUPPORTED\_PROTECTED\_OBJECT\_TYPE
