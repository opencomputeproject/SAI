## Overview 

### Need for packet action group

In the current SAI model, we do not have mechanism to match on a packet flow and replicate/load-balance packets on different ports with each copy having different packet field modifications.Using the current SAI ACL model we can match on a packet flow and replicate packets on different ports but having unique packet modification on each replicated copy is not possible.  

#### Examples

##### Example 1

Assume the requirement is to match packets with MAC SA=0xaa, MAC DA=0xbb, VLAN=10 and
replicate the packet to three ports say port 10, port 20 and port 30 in the following way:
1. In the copy to port 10, the VLAN should be set 20.
2. In the copy to port 20, the VLAN should be set 30 and the MAC DA should be set as 0xCC.
3. In the copy to port 30, the MAC SA should be set as 0xDD.

##### Example 2

Assume the requirement is to match packets with MAC SA=0xaa, MAC DA=0xbb, VLAN=10 and
load balance the packets onto two ports say port 10 and port 20 in the following way:
1.  Set VLAN 20, Output port 10.
2.  Set VLAN 30, Output port 20.

![selectgroup](figures/select_group.png "Packet Action Group Type - SELECT")

##### Example 3                                                             
Assume the requirement is to match packets with DIP=20.0.0.0/24 subnet and forward those packets to port 10 by changing the VLAN to 20 and MAC DA to 0xee.

![indirectgroup](figures/indirect_group.png "Packet Action Group Type - INDIRECT")
 

##### Example 4
Assume the requirement is to setup 2 backup failover paths for certain traffic patterns say for
IP subnet 30.0.0.0/24 on UDP port 16000 and have packet modifications in the following way:

1. Set VLAN 100, Output port 10   ---> This should act as primary path
2. Set VLAN 200, Output port 20   ---> First backup path 
3. Set VLAN 300, Output port 30   ---> Second backup path

The above requirements cannot be acheived using the current SAI model. 


### SAI Packet action group  

The SAI packet action group provides a mechanism to replicate or load-balance packets with each replicated/load-balanced packet having different packet modifications. The packet action group contains packet group members. The order of execution of actions present in group members depends on the packet action group type.

The packet action group type and the its usecases are given below

1. **All**          - Execute actions inside all the group members. This group type is used for multicast or broadcast kind of usecases.
2. **SELECT**       - Execute actions in any one of the group member  based on a switch computed selection algorithm.    Example: Hash on packet fields or simple round robin, etc. Each bucket can optionally be given preference using weights.
3. **INDIRECT**     - Execute actions in the single group member. This group type is mainly intended for faster and efficient convergence when there is a need to modify a common action across multiple flow entries.
4. **FAST FAILOVER** - Execute actions  of the first active group member. Each group member is associated with a specific port/lag that controls whether that member is active. The port/lag is considered active as long as it is able to forward traffic.The group members are evaluated in the order defined by the group by the switching entity and the first member with an active port/lag is selected.It is preferred that in case the active member fails the switching entity automatically takes next active member. However different NPUs have different capabilities and some NPUs need control plane to select the active member.

The packet group members contain the list of packet modifications which need to performed on the packet. They would have additional optional attributes based on the group to which the member belongs. For example if the member belongs to a group of type SELECT, optionally a weight attribute can be provided to influence the choice of this member. If the member belongs to a group of type FAST_FAILOVER, the port/lag object which needs to be monitored for triggering a failover can be provided.

The details of the group and group member attributes are provided in new proposed header.

The packet action group is envisioned to be in the ingress pipeline and can be specified as an ACL action currently. The following figure represent the packet action group logically

![logicalfig](figures/Packet_action_group_logical_flow.png "Logical Diagram") 


### Use-case

The usecase for SAI Packet Action Group comes from the requirement for supporting OpenFlow Groups. OpenFlow specification defines the concept of OpenFlow Groups. An OpenFlow Group consists of list of action buckets. Each action bucket has a set of actions. The action buckets which need to be executed within the OpenFlow Group depends on the type of the OpenFlow Group.

The OpenFlow Groups can be used to achieve different forwarding behaviors like flooding, multicasting, multipathing etc. Even though the OpenFlow Group resembles some of the existing SAI objects like L2MC Group, Next hop Group and Next hop object, some of functionalities/use-cases of what the OpenFlow Controller expects cannot be achieved using the current SAI objects.  


## SAI Header Changes

#### New header file for Packet Action Group Object

The attributes for the Packet Action Group and Packet Action Group member are defined in the new file:

##### Changes to existing SAI header file
**In sai.h**
1. New object for SAI Packet Action Group

```
    SAI_API_ISOLATION_GROUP     = 40, /**< sai_isolation_group_api_t */
+   SAI_API_PACKET_ACTION_GROUP = 41, /**< sai_packet_action_group_api_t */
    SAI_API_MAX                 = 42, /**< total number of APIs */

```

**In saitypes.h**
1. Add new structure for packet action group actions
2. Include the new structure in the sai_attribute_value_t structure
