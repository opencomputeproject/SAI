## Overview
When the lossy queue exceeds a buffer threshold, it drops packets without any notification to the destination host.

When a packet is lost, it can be recovered through fast retransmission (e.g., Go-Back-N in RoCE) or by using timeouts. Retransmission triggered by timeouts typically incurs significant latency. Packet trimming aims to facilitate rapid packet loss notification and, consequently, eliminate slow timeout-based retransmissions.

To help the host recover data more quickly and accurately, we introduce a packet trimming feature, that upon a failed packet admission to a shared buffer,
will trim a packet to a configured size, and try sending it on a different queue to deliver a packet drop notification to an end host.

This feature assumes that forwarding tables are configured properly, and the original packet would be delivered to the destination successfully if not for the congestion.

## Spec
There is a tradeoff between trying to configure a higher threshold in a queue buffer profile and trimming the packet.

If the user chooses to configure higher thresholds for queues, the probability of a drop on a particular queue is lower only if other ports are less congested at the moment.

However, if all the ports are equally utilized, it makes sense to create a different buffer profile for these queues, with a stricter threshold to have more fairness in shared buffer.

A static trimming threshold may not be effective with shared buffer switches, where the buffer resources allocated to a queue or port can vary over time. Therefore, we propose adding a new attribute to a buffer profile to allow configuring packet trimming on such stricter profiles:
```
/**
 * @brief Enum defining queue actions in case the packet fails to pass the admission control.
 */
typedef enum _sai_buffer_profile_packet_admission_fail_action_t
{
    /**
     * @brief Drop the packet.
     *
     * Default action. Packet has nowhere to go
     * and will be dropped.
     */
    SAI_BUFFER_PROFILE_PACKET_ADMISSION_FAIL_ACTION_DROP,

    /**
     * @brief Trim the packet.
     *
     * Try sending a shortened packet over a different
     * queue. Original packet will be dropped and trimmed copy of the packet will be send.
     * The IP length and checksum fields will be updated in a trimmed copy.
     * SAI_QUEUE_STAT_DROPPED_PACKETS as well as SAI_QUEUE_STAT_DROPPED_BYTES
     * will count the original discarded frames even if they will be trimmed afterwards.
     * Interface statistics must show dropped packets.
     * Interface statistics may show sent trimmed packets.
     */
    SAI_BUFFER_PROFILE_PACKET_ADMISSION_FAIL_ACTION_DROP_AND_TRIM,
} sai_buffer_profile_packet_admission_fail_action_t;
```
```
    /**
     * @brief Buffer profile discard action
     *
     * Action to be taken upon packet discard due to
     * buffer profile configuration. Applicable only
     * when attached to a queue.
     *
     * @type sai_buffer_profile_packet_admission_fail_action_t
     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET
     * @default SAI_BUFFER_PROFILE_PACKET_ADMISSION_FAIL_ACTION_DROP
     */
    SAI_BUFFER_PROFILE_ATTR_PACKET_ADMISSION_FAIL_ACTION,
```

Trimming engine attributes are configured globally.
```
    /**
     * @brief Trim packets to this size to reduce bandwidth
     *
     * @type sai_uint32_t
     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET
     * @default 128
     */
    SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_PACKET_TRIM_SIZE,

    /**
     * @brief New packet trim DSCP value
     *
     * @type sai_uint8_t
     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET
     * @default 0
     */
    SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_PACKET_TRIM_DSCP_VALUE,

    /**
     * @brief Queue mapping mode for a trimmed packet
     *
     * @type sai_packet_trim_queue_resolution_mode_t
     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET
     * @default SAI_PACKET_TRIM_QUEUE_RESOLUTION_MODE_STATIC
     */
    SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_PACKET_TRIM_QUEUE_RESOLUTION_MODE,

    /**
     * @brief New packet trim queue index
     *
     * @type sai_uint8_t
     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET
     * @default 0
     * @validonly SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_PACKET_TRIM_QUEUE_RESOLUTION_MODE == SAI_PACKET_TRIM_QUEUE_RESOLUTION_MODE_STATIC
     */
    SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_PACKET_TRIM_QUEUE_INDEX,
```

If more granularity is needed (e.g. trim a specific protocol, or packets within protocol), ACL action is added to disable trimming even if the packet is eligible due to a queue with a buffer profile attached that has trimming enabled.
```
    /**
     * @brief Disable packet trim for a given match condition.
     *
     * This rule takes effect only when packet trim is configured on a buffer profile of a queue to which a packet belongs.
     *
     * @type sai_acl_action_data_t bool
     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET
     * @default disabled
     */
    SAI_ACL_ENTRY_ATTR_ACTION_PACKET_TRIM_DISABLE = SAI_ACL_ENTRY_ATTR_ACTION_START + 0x39,
```

Both the queue and the port have the packet counter to reflect the number of trimmed packet.
```
    /** Packets trimmed due to failed shared buffer admission [uint64_t] */
    SAI_PORT_STAT_TRIM_PACKETS,
```
```
    /** Packets trimmed due to failed admission [uint64_t] */
    SAI_QUEUE_STAT_TRIM_PACKETS = 0x00000028,
```

It can also be beneficial to support multiple DSCP values for trimmed packets sent out via different ports. For example, trimmed packets sent to hosts will get DSCP 5 whereas trimmed packets sent to uplink/spine will have DSCP 7. It is to allow to the destination NIC to know where congestion happened - on downlinks to servers or in the fabric. Such information can be used for a better decision making on how to react to the state of network.

![](figures/trim-TC.png)

The diagram above shows the general concept - instead of setting a trim DSCP, we set a trim TC value, which, by applying a different TC to DSCP map per egres port, will yield a different DSCP value.

```
typedef enum _sai_packet_trim_dscp_resolution_mode_t
{
    /**
     * @brief Static DSCP resolution.
     *
     * In this mode, a new DSCP for the trimmed packet is set directly
     * by the application.
     */
    SAI_PACKET_TRIM_DSCP_RESOLUTION_MODE_DSCP_VALUE,

    /**
     * @brief Dynamic DSCP resolution.
     *
     * In this mode, a new DSCP for the trimmed packet is resolved from the new TRIM_TC
     * set by the application using per-port TC_TO_DSCP mapping
     */
    SAI_PACKET_TRIM_DSCP_RESOLUTION_MODE_FROM_TC
} sai_packet_trim_dscp_resolution_mode_t;
```

```
    /**
     * @brief New packet trim TC value
     *
     * @type sai_uint8_t
     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET
     * @default 0
     * @validonly SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_PACKET_TRIM_DSCP_RESOLUTION_MODE == SAI_PACKET_TRIM_DSCP_RESOLUTION_MODE_FROM_TC
     */
    SAI_SWITCH_ATTR_PACKET_TRIM_TC_VALUE,

    /**

     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET

     */
