SAI (Switch Abstraction Interface)
==============================================

The Switch Abstraction Interface defines the API to provide a
vendor-independent way of controlling forwarding elements, such as a switching
ASIC, an NPU or a software switch in a uniform manner.


IMPORTANT
=========

The "INC" directory which means "INCLUDE", has all the .h files that a vendor will include in their source code for specific implementation. 
The vendor specific implementation source code is not open to the community.
